Delphi Boot Camp August 2022
This is session 34 on Delphi and Functional Programming using Anonymous Methods
It is 1 hour and 3 minutes in length.
The reference to parallel programming in this video is out of date as the parallel example program had to be left out because the video had already exceeded its one hour limit by 3 minutes. A paralle example program will be made available to download eventually.
